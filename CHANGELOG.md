## [2.5.1] - 2025-10-30

- Added package.json to published files to ensure version information is available

## [2.5.0] - 2025-10-30

### Added
- Binary and asset file detection - automatically skips diffing for images, videos, audio, archives, executables, documents, fonts, and other binary formats
- Files without extensions are now treated as binary/asset files
- Comprehensive binary extension list covering 40+ common binary file types
- Smart file handling that shows `[File: filename - Binary/Asset file]` instead of attempting to diff binary content

### Changed

- Files like Makefile, Dockerfile, LICENSE (without extensions) are now treated as binary

## [2.4.0] - 2025-10-30

### Added
- Automatic update checker that notifies users when a new version is available
- Interactive prompt allowing users to update immediately or decline (similar to oh-my-zsh)

- Clear error messages that show actual git/AI errors instead of generic messages

### Fixed

## [2.3.1] - 2025-10-30

### Fixed
- Critical error handling issue where AI call or git commit failures would exit with code 0 instead of code 1
